->3.1 Dataset Preparation: The Road Accident data is obtained and imported into Power Query for data cleaning and transformation.<br />
<br />3.2 Data Cleaning and Transformation: Using Power Query, the data is cleaned by removing irrelevant columns, filtering out unnecessary data, and handling missing values. Transformation steps are applied to ensure the data is in a suitable format for analysis.<br />
<br />3.3 Dashboard Design: The cleaned dataset is connected to Power BI, where an interactive and visually appealing dashboard is designed. Various visualizations, such as charts, and graphs, are added to present key insights from the accident data.<br />
<br />3.4 Interactive Filters: Filters are implemented in the dashboard to allow users to slice and dice the data based on dimensions like Road Surface and Wheather Condition. This enhances the exploratory capabilities of the dashboard.<br />
<br />3.5 Calculated Measures: Using the DAX formula language, calculated measures are created to derive additional insights from the data.
